In this task, you are presented with two lotteries (i.e., Lottery A and Lottery B) on your screen's
right and left sides. Your goal is to choose the lottery that you prefer the most out of the two
lotteries that are offered to you. Make your choice by clicking on the radio button next to your
lottery.
After making your choice, please click on the 'Next' button to proceed to the next question.
You can modify your preferred option as many times as you want before pressing the 'Next'
button; however, you can no longer change your preference once you advance to the next
page. If you do not select a preferred lottery, you cannot move on to the next question.
You will play one practice lottery followed by twelve actual lotteries. Click the 'Next' button to
start.
